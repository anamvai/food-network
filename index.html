            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h4>We love eating burger which is filled with cheese and vegetables. The more vegetables you add, the better it tastes. My personal favourite is lettuce. It gives the burger the right amount of freshness and crunchiness.</h4>
            <h4>We always eat us burger with ketchup. Most importantly, the thing we love about eating burgers is that I get to eat French fries along with them. They work as a great side to the dish and also make my stomach full.</h4>

                <h4>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened and starting to turn golden. Set aside.
                    In a bowl, combine the beef mince with the herbs and the egg. Season, add the onions and mix well. Using your hands, shape into 4 patties.
                    Cook the burgers on a preheated barbecue or griddle for 5-6 minutes on each side. While the second side is cooking, lay a slice of cheese on top to melt slightly (if using).
                    Meanwhile, lightly toast the cut-sides of the buns on the barbecue. Fill with the lettuce, burgers and tomato slices. Serve with ketchup, if you like.</h4>

                <h1>Veggie Burger</h1>
                <h4>Roast the vegetables until caramelized and extra moisture has evaporated. We chop the veggies into tiny bits first and then roast them. Roast the beans for about 15 minutes so they split open and dry out a bit, A food processor helps to chop vegetables so they look like coarse crumbs. This makes up most of the burger, which means you see the little bits of vegetable throughout the patty</h4>
